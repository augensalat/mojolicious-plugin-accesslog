NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AccessLog - AccessLog Plugin

VERSION
    Version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
      # Mojolicious
      $self->plugin(AccessLog => {log => '/var/log/mojo/access.log'});

      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin AccessLog => {log => '/var/log/mojo/access.log'};

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AccessLog is a plugin to easily generate an access
    log.

OPTIONS
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AccessLog supports the following options.

  "log"
    Log data destination.

    Default: "$app->log->handle", so that access log lines go to the same
    destination as lines created with "$app->log->$method(...)".

    This option may be set to one of the following values:

   Absolute path
      plugin AccessLog => {log => '/var/log/mojo/access.log'};

    A string specifying an absolute path to the log file. If the file does
    not exist already, it will be created, otherwise log output will be
    appended to the file. The log directory must exist in every case though.

   Relative path
      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin AccessLog => {log => 'log/access.log'};

    Similar to absolute path, but relative to the application home
    directory.

   File Handle
      open $fh, '>', '/var/log/mojo/access.log';
      plugin AccessLog => {log => $fh};

      plugin AccessLog => {log => \*STDERR};

    A file handle to which log lines are printed.

   Object
      $log = IO::File->new('/var/log/mojo/access.log', O_WRONLY|O_APPEND);
      plugin AccessLog => {log => $log};

      $log = Log::Dispatch->new(...);
      plugin AccessLog => {log => $log};

    An object, that implements either a "print" method (like IO::Handle
    based classes) or an "info" method (i.e. Log::Dispatch or
    Log::Log4perl).

   Callback routine
      $log = Log::Dispatch->new(...);
      plugin AccessLog => {
        log => sub { $log->log(level => 'debug', message => @_) }
      };

    A code reference. The provided subroutine will be called for every log
    line, that it gets as a single argument.

  "format"
    A string to specify the format of each line of log output.

    Default: "common" (see below).

    This plugin implements a subset of Apache's LogFormat
    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html>.

    %%  A percent sign.

    %a  Remote IP-address.

    %A  Local IP-address.

    %b  Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers. In CLF format,
        i.e. a '-' rather than a 0 when no bytes are sent.

    %B  Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers.

    %D  The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds.

    %h  Remote host. See "hostname_lookups" below.

    %H  The request protocol.

    %l  The remote logname, not implemented: currently always '-'.

    %m  The request method.

    %p  The port of the server serving the request.

    %P  The process ID of the child that serviced the request.

    %r  First line of request: Request method, request URL and request
        protocol. Synthesized from other fields, so it may not be the
        request verbatim.

    %s  The HTTP status code of the response.

    %t  Time the request was received (standard english format).

    %T  Custom field for handling times in subclasses.

    %u  Remote user, or '-'.

    %U  The URL path requested, not including any query string.

    %v  The name of the server serving the request.

    %V  The name of the server serving the request.

    In addition, custom values can be referenced, using "%{name}", with one
    of the mandatory modifier flags "i", "o", "t", "C" or "e":

    %{RequestHeaderName}i
        The contents of request header "RequestHeaderName".

    %{ResponseHeaderName}o
        The contents of response header "ResponseHeaderName".

    %{Format}t
        The time, in the form given by "Format", which should be in
        strftime(3) format.

    %{CookieName}C
        The contents of cookie "CookieName" in the request sent to the
        server.

    %{VariableName}e
        The contents of environment variable "VariableName".

    Non-printable bytes are replaced by an escape sequence of "\x.." with
    ".." being the hexadecimal code of the replaced byte.

    For mostly historical reasons template names "common" or "combined" can
    also be used:

    common
          %h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b

    combined
          %h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i"

    These format template names have two drawbacks though:

    1.  The username (%u) is not quoted, but a username is allowed to
        contain spaces. As a consequence, log file parsers might lose track
        of the right fields. To get around this, spaces in usernames are
        replaced by "\x20" if one of the format template names is used.

    2.  The remote logname %l as provided by an ident service is not usefull
        these days and therefore not supported, %l is always substituted by
        a hyphen ("-").

  "hostname_lookups"
    Enable reverse DNS hostname lookup if "true". Keep in mind, that this
    adds latency to every request, if %h is part of the log line, because it
    requires a DNS lookup to complete before the request is finished.
    Default is "false" (= disabled).

  "uname_helper"
      plugin AccessLog => {
        log => '/var/log/mojo/access.log',
        uname_helper => 'set_username',
      };

      ...

      # custom authentication for all following resources
      under => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        my $username = $self->param('username') || '';

        if ($username =~ /^mc/) {   # Scottish only 
          $self->set_username($username);
        }
        else {
          $self->render('denied');
          return undef;
        }
      };

    Define a name for a helper to set the username. The default is to use
    the username part of the "userinfo" in Mojo::URL. With a custom
    "uname_helper" any identifier can be set for the user value in the log
    file.

METHODS
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AccessLog inherits all methods from
    Mojolicious::Plugin and implements the following new ones.

  "register"
      $plugin->register(
        Mojolicious->new, {
          log => '/var/log/mojo/access.log',
          format => 'combined',
        }
      );

    Register plugin hooks in Mojolicious application.
